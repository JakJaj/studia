A lot can go wrong when you research. Experiments donâ€™t work, papers get rejected, colleagues are not very collegial. While all this is a part of research, it can still result in loss of motivation, self-doubt, and leave you questioning your impact as a scientist.Our upcoming webinar will teach you how to deal with the not-so-exciting part of research and techniques that can help you stay healthy while you work. You will learn how to deal with setbacks, strategies to deal with imposter syndrome and how to switch off and take care of yourself.
